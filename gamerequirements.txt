You have a choice to make something of yourself in the streets by performing crimes like burglary, selling drugs, manufacturing drugs, credit card fraud, robbery, theft, hijacking, credit card skimming, OR become a police officer and follow the law route where you can "catch" the bad guys through various tasks similar to crimes. As you rise to the top you upgrade and acquire new properties, businesses and more. You can create "gangs" and for police you can create "tasks force" that are equal to "gangs".
